          <h2>In short</h2>
            <p class="fullwidth">
              I believe there is a very high variance in terms of code quality from one C++ code base to another.
              It's hard to know what to expect when joining a team that's writing C++ because it can fall anywhere
                from `C with classes` to policy-based generic code that takes 45 minutes to build.
              The language, tooling, and community have improved a lot since C++11, however I believe that C++ is not
                a good tool for large projects in that it doesn't help users avoid mistakes and manage complexity.

          <h3>Performance</h3>
            <p class="fullwidth">
              I feel like we get 80% of the performance for 20% of the effort.
              We can just write simple code, and modern compilers will find amazing ways to opimize it,
              and it's easy enough to measure and control memory allocations.
            </p>

          <h3>Libraries</h3>
            <p class="fullwidth">
                The STL has a good selection of containers, algorithms, and type traits.
                There are old, stable, and documented libraries like
                  <a href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>,
                  <a href="http://www.quickfixengine.org/">QuickFIX</a>,
                  <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest">googletest</a>...<br />
                There are new, good quality libraries for a number of common tasks, like
                  <a href="https://github.com/nlohmann/json">JSON</a>,
                  <a href="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt">fmt</a>,
                  <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2">Catch2</a>,
                  <a href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11">pyBind11</a>...
            </p>

          <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p class="fullwidth">
                Compilers have improved warnings a lot, and sanitizers are very good at catching a number of bugs early on.
                A simple CI setup can now help produce programs of a much higher quality than just a few years ago.
            </p>
            
          <h3>Best practices</h3>
          
          <h2>I don't like</h2>
          
          <h3>Old habits die hard</h3>
            <ul class="fullwidth">
              <li><q>New compilers have bugs.</q></li>
              <li><q>Modern C++ is juste more complex for no benefit.</q></li>
              <li><q>Clang is slow and doesn't optimize well.</q></li>
              <li><q>GCC generates the best output with `-march=nocona`</q></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="fullwidth">
                There are still large C++ projects stuck on whatever comes with RHEL 5 or 6 (gcc 4.4.X).
                Anything below 4.8 is painful to use since it won't even implement most of C++11.
                It would be nice to have a clear governance when it comes to language/implementation versions.

          <h3>Unsafe defaults</h3>
        
          <h3>Distribution</h3>
            <p class="fullwidth">
              It's not easy to distribute a C++ library, in particular across platforms.
            </p>
        
          <h3>Build tools</h3>
        
          <h3>Debugging</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Debugging C++ can mean stepping through a large amount of boilerplate generic code and/or macros, espcially when using libraries like the STL and Boost.
            </p>

                      Modern C++ constructs like &quot;for (auto&amp; x : xs)&quot; look pretty, but they destroy the ability to single step in debug mode without template hell

          <h3>Stealthy complexity</h3>
            <p class="fullwidth">
              There are many things that look simple but have hidden complexity or traps.
              For example, see this presentation on <a href="https://www.aristeia.com/TalkNotes/C++TypeDeductionandWhyYouCareCppCon2014.pdf">type deduction</a> by Scott Meyers.
              Let's not even start talking about templates.
