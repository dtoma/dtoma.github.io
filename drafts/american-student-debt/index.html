<blockquote>
<p>for decades, students have worked hard and played by the rules. They took on loans on the promise that a college education would justify their debt and provide a ticket to the middle class. But our country’s experiment with debt-financed education went terribly wrong: instead of getting ahead, millions of student loan borrowers are barely treading water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s how it will work:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll direct the Secretary of Education to use their authority to begin to compromise and modify federal student loans consistent with my plan to cancel up to $50,000 in debt for 95% of student loan borrowers (about 42 million people).</li>
<li>I’ll also direct the Secretary of Education to use every existing authority available to rein in the for-profit college industry, crack down on predatory student lending, and combat the racial disparities in our higher education system.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>People thought that more debt would mean more education and therefore higher earnings. But instead, the labor market credentialized,
reducing the earnings associated with any given level of attainment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Looney, a former U.S. Treasury official in the Obama administration, likens the job of constructing a debt cancellation policy to loan relief for subprime mortgages during the financial crisis.
He explicitly says that it was too difficult to distinguish between the deserving and undeserving and to balance that against the “cost,” presumably of spending too much federal money on those who didn’t really need a bailout […]
The Obama administration cared so much about the deserving/undeserving distinction and the technocratic details behind getting it right that it didn’t enact significant loan forgiveness, and in response millions of families lost their homes to foreclosure, giving rise to an economic and political backlash that may well have influenced the outcome of the 2016 election.</p>

<p>lower-income households would get the largest relief relative to their incomes. This is a standard way to evaluate the distributional impacts of policy changes.</p>
