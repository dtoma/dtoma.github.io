          <h3>Performance</h3>
            <p class="text">
              I feel like we get 80% of the performance for 20% of the effort.
              Modern compilers will find amazing ways to opimize our code as long as it we don't make it a hairy mess,
              and it's easy enough to measure and control memory allocations.
            </p>

          <h3>Libraries</h3>
            <p class="text">
                The STL has a good selection of containers, algorithms, and type traits.
                There are old, stable, and documented libraries like [Boost](), [QuickFIX](), [googletest]()...
                There are new, good quality libraries for a number of common tasks, like [JSON](), [fmt](), [Catch2](), [](pyBind11)...
            </p>

          <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p class="text">
                Compilers have improved warnings a lot, and sanitizers are very good at catching a number of bugs early on.
                A simple CI setup can now help produce programs of a much higher quality than just a few years ago.
            </p>
            
          <h3>Best practices</h3>
          
          <h2>I don't like</h2>
          
          <h3>Old habits die hard</h3>
            <ul class="text">
              <li><q>New compilers have bugs.</q></li>
              <li><q>Modern C++ is juste more complex for no benefit.</q></li>
              <li><q>Clang is slow and doesn't optimize well.</q></li>
              <li><q>GCC generates the best output with `-march=nocona`</q></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
                There are still large C++ projects stuck on whatever comes with RHEL 5 or 6 (gcc 4.4.X).
                Anything below 4.8 is painful to use since it won't even implement most of C++11.
                It would be nice to have a clear governance when it comes to language/implementation versions.

          <h3>Debugging</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Debugging C++ can mean stepping through a large amount of boilerplate generic code and/or macros, espcially when using libraries like the STL and Boost.

                      Modern C++ constructs like &quot;for (auto&amp; x : xs)&quot; look pretty, but they destroy the ability to single step in debug mode without template hell
