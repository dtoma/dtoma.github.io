<h3 id="professional-cmake-a-practical-guide">Professional CMake: A Practical Guide</h3>
<p><em>Craig SCOTT</em></p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆</p>
<p>A reference manual for CMake. I was hoping for something more like a project-based walkthrough, but it is very thorough and a useful reference for many topics.</p>
<p>I often discover a feature in the book, try to use it, then Google my way around making it work for my use case. Overall, this has simplified my build configurations greatly, for example using <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#command:fetchcontent_declare">FetchContent_Declare</a> and <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#command:fetchcontent_makeavailable">FetchContent_MakeAvailable</a> to manage dependencies.</p>
<p>There are also pages summarizing best practices which I find very useful to get an idea of how to do thing well.</p>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<h3 id="developer-hegemony">Developer Hegemony</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Future of Labor</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Erik Dietrich</em></p>
<p><em>Read in Progress</em></p>
<p>The author’s thoughts on how to manage one’s career as a programmer, and his observations and experiences from working in large companies, startups, and as an independant consultant.</p>
<h2 id="nonfiction">Nonfiction</h2>
<h3 id="the-visual-display-of-quantitative-information">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</h3>
<p><em>Edward R. TUFTE</em></p>
<p><em>Read in Progress</em></p>
<p>A book about… what the title says.</p>
<p>The first part of the book shows how people have found ways to display data in order to make it easy to grasp. My favorite one is this map, showing the size of Napoleon’s army during his campaign in Russia:</p>

<h3 id="ur-fascism">Ur-Fascism</h3>
<p><em>Umberto Eco</em></p>
<p>★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆</p>
<p>Not really a book, just 9 pages. Umberto Eco writes about “what is fascism?”. I think this is a useful question to ask even today, as we hear people calling each other fascists so often (especially on Twitter).</p>
<p>He observes that many regimes have been called “fascist” while having different characteristics: for example, Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco ran very different ships. This brief text tries to define “Ur-Fascism”, or “Eternal Fascism”, the root of all fascisms, as having the following traits (edited for brevity):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cult of tradition, being <em>syncretistic</em> (the amalgamation or attempted amalgamation of different religions, cultures, or schools of thought) while tolerating inevitable contradictions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of the original messages contains a silver of wisdom, and whenever they seem to say different or incompatible things it is only because all are alluding, allegorically, to the same primeval truth. […]</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Rejection of modernism, cult of <em>action for action’s sake</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation. […] Distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur-Fascism, from Goering’s alleged statement (“When I hear talk of culture I reach for my gun”) to the frequent use of such expressions as “degenerate intellectuals”, “eggheads”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Disagreement is treason</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Obsession with a plot, common ennemy or ennemies, or frustrations</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To people who feel deprived of a clear social identity, Ur-Fascism says that their only privilege is the most common one, to be born in the same country. This is the origin of nationalism. Besides, the only ones who can provide an identity to the nation are its enemies. When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people.They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help eachother through a secret web of mutual assistance.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Contempt for the weak, popular elitism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every citizen belongs to the best peopleof the world, the members of the party are the best among the citizens […] Since the groupis hierarchically organized (according to a military model), every subordinate leader despises his own underlings, and each of them despises his inferiors. This reinforces the sense of mass elitism.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Newspeak</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newspeak was invented by Orwell, in 1984 […] the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning. But we must be ready to identify other kinds of Newspeak, even if they take the apparently innocent form of a popular talk show.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2>
<h3 id="the-murder-of-roger-ackroyd">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</h3>
<p><em>Agatha Christie</em></p>
<p><span class="stars" rating="8"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16328.The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd">Goodreads</a></p>
<p>Can’t really say why it’s good without spoiling it, but it’s good and well worth a read. An unusual plot twist.</p>
<h2 id="science-fiction">Science-Fiction</h2>
<h3 id="section">14</h3>
<p><em>Peter Clines</em></p>
<p><span class="stars" rating="7"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14">Goodreads</a></p>
<p>A guy finds a nice studio in an old building, for a surprisingly cheap rent. Turns out the building is weird and stuff happens.</p>
<p>I found this book fun and easy to read. The characters and dialogues were entertaining and the plot was interesting.</p>
