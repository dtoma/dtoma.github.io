        <p>Stories from my programming job interviews - on both sides of the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to find people arguing that the hiring process in tech is broken, or that it&rsquo;s not good enough at filtering bad hires, or any other point of view. I&rsquo;ve been through a few interviews over the years, and I feel like although no process is perfect, it often comes down to having a clear process and people who are good at conducting interviews.</p>
<h2 id="internships-as-a-student">Internships as a student<a href="#internships-as-a-student" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<h3 id="my-first-internship-success">My first internship [success]<a href="#my-first-internship-success" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<ul>
<li>Company size: ~100</li>
<li>Sector: consulting, business intelligence</li>
<li>Role: programmer (internship)</li>
<li>Referral: yes</li>
</ul>
<p>The interview process was very approachable: no whiteboard coding, a short questionnaire about my experiences (and <em>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the last book you&rsquo;ve read?&quot;</em>, which we talked about for a while since we both loved the book I mentioned), and a chat with the president. This was a very humane company and we ended up with a group of good people who could work together well.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-job-in-a-big-company-success">My first job in a big company [success]<a href="#my-first-job-in-a-big-company-success" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<ul>
<li>Company size: ~150'000</li>
<li>Sector: finance</li>
<li>Role: programmer (internship)</li>
<li>Referral: no</li>
</ul>
<p>The process began with a 1 hour meeting with the team manager. A few days later, the person who would take charge of my internship took 1 hou to do some whiteboad coading, using simple questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s a lambda?</li>
<li>How would you sort an array?</li>
<li>Can you write a simple function that does X, Y, or Z?</li>
</ul>
<p>My only regret was to not meet more team members during the hiring process, it turned out to be a sign that the team was not a very close-knit bunch. I ended up being seated on the other side of the office, and they&rsquo;d forget to include me when going out for lunch, sad :(</p>
<p>At the time, the team didn&rsquo;t have a process defined for interviewing candidates, so the content of an interview would depend on a lot on who was conducting it. A few years later, we would setup three big improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a standard list of questions to avoid bias from each interviewing having his favourite trick question</li>
<li>give a clear purpose to each of the meetings, to avoid wasting time by going in different directions during a single hour</li>
<li>try to make sure a candidate would meet most of the team members before joining
This ended up making for an average of ~4 meetings from receiving a resume to hiring a candidate, which was probably not too bad compary to the industry standard.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>The whole hiring process was quite time consuming, but enjoyable because the interviewers were quite friendly. It went through these interviews while working for another company, using evenings and half-days of paid leave.</p>
<p>First round: a questionnaire. A few pages (maybe 10?) of questions about Python, Linux, git, finance&hellip; the idea behind this was to get an overview of what a candidate knew, and what their blind spots were.</p>
<p>Second round: whiteboad coding. An hour of solving puzzles on a whiteboard, using questions that were not too difficult and gave room to explore more in-depth.</p>
<p>Third round: systems design. An hour of designing a system (drawing on a whiteboard) according to the requirements given by the interviewer.</p>
<p>Fourth round: take-home project. The goal was to write a CLI to fetch, shuffle, and display some data from an external API, in a week or so. I then went back to their office, and a few people reviewed my code, asked questions about my decisions and trade-offs, suggested improvements, and asked some general questions about the domain behind this specific project. I felt this project was scoped appropriately for someone who is working full-time and can only find a few hours here and there to work on side projects.</p>
<p>Fifth round: a phone call for a personality check by one of the senior employees.</p>
<p>I did meet most of the employees during this process, however I didn&rsquo;t meet the person who would end up being my manager, which in retrospect I should have made sure to do. I was fired from this company after ~2.5 years, which I believe shows no process, no matter how many steps it involves, can guarantee a good hire.</p>

<p>This one involved a weekend project, writing a small C++ program and sending it to the interviewer for review. Most of the problem could be solved by using the right data structures from the standard library, in this case a <code>std::map</code> with a custom ordering. I also used CMake as a build system and dependency manager, and added some logging (using spdlog), tests (using GoogleTest) and micro-benchmarks (using Google&rsquo;s Benchmark).</p>
<p>The second step was to spend a day in their office, roughly from 10:00 to 18:00, with a different person every hour asking questions on programming or trading. They invited me for lunch, which was very nice. Overall the process was rather enjoyable most of the interviewers knew how to drive a good conversation, although it amounted to a full 3 days of work, which would have been difficult had I not been unemployed at the time.</p>
<p>In the end, they decided to pass on my application and look for someone more senior with better knowledge of low-latency infrastructure and programming.</p>

<ul>
<li>Company size: ~1'400</li>
<li>Sector: finance</li>
<li>Role: programmer (permanent employee)</li>
<li>Referral: no</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step was an online coding interview using some Hackerrank/GoogleDoc hybrid website that allowed the interviewer to setup some problems, let me write code to solve them, and see my answers. This was for a Python programming role, so the questions focused on Python basics (how to pass a lambda to a function, how to use standard data structures, how to use decorators and context managers&hellip;). After receiving positive feedback from the interviewer, I was invited to the next round.</p>
<p>The second roud was a phone call with the team manager, a business person (not a programmer). This was a bit more awkward as I didn&rsquo;t actually have to answer that many questions - the interviewer spent a lot of time explaining how great the company was and how everyone in the industry would be envious of anyone working there. Also, overtime and lack of social life were mentioned <strong>frequently</strong> during the phone call. I didn&rsquo;t receive any feedback from this round, but I was still invited to the next one.</p>
<p>The last round was a phone call with a high level manager in the fund&rsquo;s home country. The main question for this interview was: &ldquo;Tell me about an impressive project you&rsquo;ve worked on&rdquo;. I can see how this can be a great question for some candidates, however at this point I&rsquo;d mostly worked on what I was asked to, and I didn&rsquo;t consider any of that <em>impressive</em>. I could tell the interviewer thought the same.</p>
<p>In the end, they came back to me with the news that they didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to handle the job.</p>

<ul>
<li>Company size: ~140'000</li>
<li>Sector: Tech</li>
<li>Role: programmer (permanent employee)</li>
<li>Referral: yes</li>
</ul>
<p>Much has been written on the internet about interviewing at any of the GAFA(-M, -N, etc.). My best friends while preparing for the interviews were Hackerrank, and Steven Skiena&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Algorithm Design Manual&rdquo;. I focused on simple trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and some basic dynamic programming, thinking that having solid basics would help me face most of the questions I&rsquo;d be asked. If I couldn&rsquo;t solve a difficult problem after 45 minutes, with help from my interviewer, so be it. I would read the chapter on a given topic from Skiena&rsquo;s book, and implement the code in Python, writing some tests along the way to make sure my implementation was correct and I really understood what I was doing.</p>
<p>After the initial &ldquo;coding on Google Docs&rdquo; filtering interview, the whole process had to take place remotely because of COVID-19, most of it in one day.</p>
<p>The coding interviews were very nice. The questions all started simple, and as I solved each step, the interviewer would add a new one on top (eg. reduce complexity, reduce memory usage&hellip;), until I either finished the problem or ran out of time. There were no big surprise, the questions were more or less scenarised but they were all solvable using standard data structures and algorithms. In my case, I had to work with binary trees, basic graphs, and logic.</p>
<p>I probably flunked the systems design interview by over-engineering my solution from the start. Luckily the interviewer guided me back to a simpler solution, but by them I had wasted a lot of time. I guess the lesson there is to try to solve the problem, not recite design patterns.</p>
<p>The HR/personality interview was quite pleasant, nothing tricky, just a good conversation.</p>
<p>After a few days I received the good news: my application would move on to the next step, ie &ldquo;finding a team&rdquo;. I had a few phone calls with managers (as I mentioned earlier, always meet the manager during the hiring process!), and ended up receiving an offer shortly after.</p>

<p>This candidate showed up with a decent CV, with a decade or two in large companies working on projects that looked serious. However, after 30 minutes of effort we still hadn&rsquo;t finished solving this puzzle:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">/*
</span><span style="color:#75715e"> * Reverse a string. Feel free to use raw pointers,
</span><span style="color:#75715e"> * the STL, Boost, or any common library you like.
</span><span style="color:#75715e"> */</span>
<span style="color:#75715e">/* type */</span> reverse_string(<span style="color:#75715e">/* type */</span> str) {
    <span style="color:#75715e">/* your implementation */</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>It turned out this candidate was looking for something more on the management side, whereas we were explicitely looking for a C++ programmer whose main responsibility would be refactoring and adding new features to an existing code base.</p>
<p>This was a lesson in filtering candidates properly before wasting their time making them come to our office.</p>
<h2 id="the-candidate-who-was-good-but-also-not-good-interview-no-go">The candidate who was good, but also not good [interview] [no-go]<a href="#the-candidate-who-was-good-but-also-not-good-interview-no-go" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>This candidate had a pretty solid resume, almost a decade of relevant experience, and I was very happy with the result of a technical interview I put him through. However, two other colleagues interviewed him right after, and they felt he wouldn&rsquo;t be good enough for the team.</p>
<p>It turned out we had asked wildly different questions&hellip; because our two teams worked on very different projects. My team needed to iterate quickly on simple projects, so I asked questions about basic data structures, using the STL, and testing code. My colleagues worked on low latency software, so they asked about memory models, kernel bypass, and advanced optimization techniques.</p>
<p>Our manager took all of our feedback and ended up not going further with this candidate. My team decided to standardize a set of questions depending on which project the candidate would be working on, as we didn&rsquo;t want to reject other potential good hires just because they didn&rsquo;t satisfy the other team&rsquo;s technical requirements. This proved out to be very useful on the long run, as it also made it easier for people who were interviewing candidates for the first time, and it made our feedback more consistent.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-candidate-who-didnt-convince-everyone-interviewer-no-go">The good candidate who didn&rsquo;t convince everyone [interviewer] [no-go]<a href="#the-good-candidate-who-didnt-convince-everyone-interviewer-no-go" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>We had a candidate pass our coding interview with flying colours, and the 2 interviewers came out of the meeting with a good impression of him. We invited him to meet the team confident that we&rsquo;d hire him, yet after one hour, most of the team members were not convinced he would be a good fit, and had a bad first impression of that candidate&rsquo;s overall behavior.</p>
<p>We ended up with a &ldquo;no go&rdquo;, and it reinforced our belief that it was important for a candidate to meet most of the team before we took any decision, even if they seemed good enough technically.</p>
<h2 id="the-one-who-spoke-klingon-interviewer-go">The one who spoke Klingon [interviewer] [go]<a href="#the-one-who-spoke-klingon-interviewer-go" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I wanted to hire this candidate as soon as I saw &ldquo;Klingon&rdquo; in the language section of his resume. We did however have a process to follow by that point, so we went through a technical interview, a meeting with the team, a meeting with the management, and he ended up with an offer as soon as we were done.</p>
<p>I handled the technical interview and it was great, we solved some quick puzzles on a whiteboard before talking about more general topics like how to serialize data when sharing between processes, what kind of data or programs should keep in memory or in a database, what kind of database would be most appropriate, and so on. Athough the CV had caught my eye first because of the Star Trek reference, it turned out to be a genuinely good candidate.</p>
