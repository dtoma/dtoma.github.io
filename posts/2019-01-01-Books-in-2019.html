<h3 id="roger-lowenstein---when-genius-failed---the-rise-and-fall-of-long-term-capital-management">Roger LOWENSTEIN - When Genius Failed - The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management</h3>
<p>A book about the rise and fall of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">Long-Term Capital Management</a>. I thought it was interesting to see famous academics joining the team to confront their theories to the reality of the markets. Many famous names in the book. The narration is a bit slow, it could have been a few pages shorter, but overall interesting and entertaining.</p>
<h3 id="haruki-murakami---men-without-women">Haruki MURAKAMI - Men Without Women</h3>
<p>A collection of short stories, reminded me of “Je voudrais que quelqu’un m’attende quelque part” from Anna Gavalda. All the stories’ endings are very open to interpretation, somewhat bittersweet. A good quick read.</p>
<h3 id="john-bogle---the-little-book-of-common-sense-investing">John BOGLE - The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</h3>
<p>A short book with lots of diagrams showing why it can make sense to invest in ETFs rather than active funds. Clear and easy to follow.</p>
<h3 id="lee-child---killing-floor">Lee CHILD - Killing Floor</h3>
<p>First book of the Jack Reacher series. First person narration, lots of short sentences, making it feel like the main characters has some behavioral flaws. Lots of action, bit of a Jason Bourne on steroids. Reads nice and fast, entertaining.</p>
<h3 id="lee-child---die-trying">Lee CHILD - Die Trying</h3>
<p>Second book of the Jack Reacher series. Third person narration, we have to follow multiple characters at the same time, which didn’t flow as nicely as the first book IMO. Definitely Jason Bourne on steroids.</p>
