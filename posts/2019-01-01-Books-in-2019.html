<h4 id="when-genius-failed---the-rise-and-fall-of-long-term-capital-management">When Genius Failed - The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management</h4>
<p>A book about the rise and fall of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">Long-Term Capital Management</a>, a hedge fund from the 1990s. I thought it was interesting to see famous academics joining the team to confront their theories to the reality of the markets. Many famous names in the book. The narration is a bit slow, it could have been a few pages shorter, but overall interesting and entertaining.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black swans happen, and are not always covered or anticipated by academics</li>
<li>The more leverage we have, the more we need to prepare for unlikely events</li>
<li>When things get bad enough, governments and banks can work together to avoid worst-case scenarios</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="men-without-women">Men Without Women</h4>
<p>A collection of short stories, reminded me of “Je voudrais que quelqu’un m’attende quelque part” from Anna Gavalda. The stories are slices of life, each one about a man’s relationship with a woman. The endings are very open to interpretation, somewhat bittersweet.</p>
<p>A good quick read.</p>
<h3 id="john-bogle">John BOGLE</h3>
<h4 id="the-little-book-of-common-sense-investing">The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</h4>
<p>A short book with lots of diagrams showing why it can make sense to invest in ETFs rather than active funds. Clear and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Two points that summarize this book, in my opinion:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Few active money managers beat the market</li>
<li>If you are paying management fees of, then your active money manager beat the market by more than the fees to be worth it</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe high school or university student should read this, to get a basic idea of what to do with their money once they start earning it.</p>
<h3 id="jim-butcher">Jim BUTCHER</h3>
<h4 id="the-dresden-files-books-1-to-15">The Dresden Files (books 1 to 15)</h4>
<p>Harry Dresden is the only wizard detective of Chicago. He’s a confident idiot who wields both revolvers and fireballs (and sarcasm). As he investigates a series of homicides, he ends up in more trouble he could ever have imagined. As the series goes on, the main character learns a lot and matures along the way, makes friends, loses friends. Very entertaining!</p>
<h3 id="lee-child">Lee CHILD</h3>
<h4 id="killing-floor-jack-reacher-book-1">Killing Floor (Jack Reacher book 1)</h4>
<p>First book of the Jack Reacher series. First person narration, lots of short sentences, making it feel like the main characters has some behavioral flaws. Lots of action, bit of a Jason Bourne on steroids. Reads nice and fast, entertaining.</p>
<h4 id="die-trying-jack-reacher-book-2">Die Trying (Jack Reacher book 2)</h4>
<p>Second book of the Jack Reacher series. This time in third person narration, we have to follow multiple characters at the same time, which I felt didn’t flow as nicely as the first book. Definitely Jason Bourne on steroids.</p>
<h4 id="jack-reacher-books-3-to-10">Jack Reacher books 3 to 10</h4>
<p>All easy and entertaining reads. Plots are okay, lots of action, a few side stories along the way to keep the main character interesting. Will read more of this series.</p>
<h3 id="brandon-sanderson">Brandon SANDERSON</h3>
<h4 id="the-mistborn-trilogy">The Mistborn Trilogy</h4>
<p>In a world where people can eat metals to gain magical powers, a young woman goes from beggar to hero when she discovers her own rare and powerful abilities.</p>
<p>I loved the first tome, liked the second one, and bore through the third one. I felt that it started off full of action, new ideas, punchy dialogue, and slowly became slower, more depressing, with a lot of inner dialogue from multiple characters towards the end. I guess since the end of the world is coming, it makes sense to change the mood of the characters accordingly, I just had a hard time finishing it.</p>
<p>I was also not a fan of the ending, which felt a bit like a Deus Ex Machina. Overall worth a read.</p>
